This project serves as a valuable learning tool for both students learning Zhuyin (also known as Bopomofo) and teachers instructing it. It provides a visually engaging and user-friendly way to practice and reinforce recognition of these essential Mandarin phonetic symbols.

## Features

* **Interactive Flashcards:** Click on a card to reveal the corresponding Bopomofo symbol.  This interactive element makes learning more engaging for students.
* **Shuffled Decks:** The order of the Bopomofo symbols is randomized each time the page loads, providing a fresh learning experience and preventing memorization based on card order. This is particularly helpful for repeated practice.
* **Categorized Sections:** Bopomofo symbols are divided into three sections: Initials (聲符), Medials (介音), and Finals (韻符).  This categorization helps learners understand the structure and components of Zhuyin, making it easier to grasp the phonetic system.  Teachers can use these sections to focus on specific aspects of Bopomofo.
* **Visual Feedback:** The last flipped card in each section is highlighted, offering a clear visual cue for the user's progress. This allows both learners and teachers to track progress and focus on areas needing more attention.
* **Clean and Simple UI:**  The interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, making it accessible for learners of all ages and technical abilities.
* **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
